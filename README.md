# rock-paper-scissors-master
This is a solution to the Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge on Frontend Mentor.
Users can play the game against the computer, and the score is maintained even after refreshing the browser.

## The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser (optional)

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I Learned
Working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:
- Managing state in JavaScript without frameworks
- Using `localStorage` to persist data across page reloads
- Handling user interactions and updating the DOM dynamically
- Using CSS transitions and animations to enhance user experience
